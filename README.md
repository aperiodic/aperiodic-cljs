# aperiodic-cljs

This is what I consider a bare-bones starting point for clojurescript
development. It contains a simple compojure app to serve a hiccup-rendered page
that loads the compiled clojurescript.

## Usage

Compile the clojurescript with `lein cljsbuild once`, then start the development
server with `lein ring server`.
